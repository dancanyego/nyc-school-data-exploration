# Analyzing NYC High School Data

This project analyzes data from New York City public high schools to understand various factors affecting SAT scores and student performance. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python's data analysis libraries.

## Overview

The notebook focuses on exploring and visualizing relationships between various demographic and academic metrics from NYC public high schools. It specifically investigates the following:

- The correlation between SAT scores and other factors such as class size, demographics, and survey responses.
- Identifying schools with low enrollment and low SAT scores.
- Visualizing key relationships to understand how different variables interact.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis includes:

- SAT scores by school
- School demographic information
- School survey data
- Advanced Placement (AP) exam results
- Graduation outcomes

## Key Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Notable Sections

- **Data Cleaning**: The notebook starts by cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, handling missing values, and merging different datasets into a single `DataFrame`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook includes several exploratory data analysis steps to understand the distribution of data and relationships between variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: It calculates correlations between SAT scores and other variables to identify significant relationships.
- **Visualization**: The analysis is supported by various visualizations, including scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.



## Conclusion

The analysis provides insights into how various factors correlate with SAT scores in NYC public high schools. This can inform educational policies and help identify areas where schools might need additional support.
